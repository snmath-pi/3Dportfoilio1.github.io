        <h2>üìú About me</h2>
        <p>
          I'm a highly competitive and motivated person. I'm always trying to explore new technological domains and do my best to obtain a substantial amount of expertise in them.
          I thoroughly love programming and I've been doing it for almost 2 years now.
        </p>

        <p>
          Besides programming I love problem solving and mathematics and that's the main reason I am very active in field of sports programming and competitive mathematics. 
          I love exploring and unraveling the beauty of vast amount of data structures and algorithms.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm competitive and love to compete. I believe that chasing progress is a better end goal than chasing perfection. Every day I put efforts to make myself better not only in IT but various fields of life. I commit mistakes and improve to be better next time!
